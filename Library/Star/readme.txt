Stellar Spectrum Choices

For all files, the first column is wavelength in nm, and the second column is stellar flux at 1 AU distance in W/m2/nm.

For each scenario, “name of star.txt” is the file that contains the stellar spectrum, from EUV to IR. “name of star _0.txt” is the file that contains the stellar spectrum from FUV (100 nm) to IR.

We have in total 15 scenarios, and 30 spectra as choices.

1.	Sun and Sun-like Stars

We use the Air Mass Zero standard reference spectrum. In 2000, the American Society for Testing and Materials developed an AM 0 reference spectrum (ASTM E-490) for use by the aerospace community. That ASTM E490 Air Mass Zero solar spectral irradiance is based on data from satellites, space shuttle missions, high-altitude aircraft, rocket soundings, ground-based solar telescopes, and modeled spectral irradiance. The integrated spectral irradiance has been made to conform to the value of the solar constant accepted by the space community; which is 1366.1 W/m2.

For the extreme-UV spectrum, we use the average quiet-Sun emission provided by Curdt et al. 2001, A&A, 375, 591.

2.	F-type Stars

We use F2V star HD 128167 (tau Bootis) as the archetype for F-type stars. We use the spectrum compiled by Segura et al. 2003, Astrobiology, 3, 689.

The EUV spectrum is scaled from the Lyman-alpha flux according to empirical scaling laws derived by Linsky et al. 2014, ApJ, 780, 61.

3.	K-type Stars

We use the results of the MUSCLES survey. The survey uses Hubble observations in the UV to reconstruct intrinsic stellar Lyman-alpha emissions, and estimate EUV emissions from the Lyman-alpha emission according to empirical scaling laws derived by Linsky et al. 2014, ApJ, 780, 61. The visible spectrum is obtained from ground-based observations, and the infrared spectrum is from the PHOENIX stellar atmosphere models.

Details of the MUSCLE survey are presented in France et al. 2016, ApJ, 820, 89.

We have following inactive or weakly active stars for choice.
HD 85512	K6V, Teff = 4305 K
HD 40307	K2.5V, Teff = 4783 K
HD 97658	K1V, Teff = 5156 K

We have the following active stars for choice (non-flare phase).
Eps Eri	K2V star, Teff = 5162 K

4.	M-type Stars

We use the results of the MUSCLES survey. We have the following inactive and weakly active stars for choice.

GJ 1214	M4.5V, Teff = 2935 K
GJ 876		M5V, Teff = 3062 K
GJ 581		M5V, Teff = 3295 K
GJ 436		M3.5V, Teff= 3281 K
GJ 176		M2.5V, Teff = 3416 K
GJ 667C	M1.5V, Teff = 3327 K
GJ 832		M1.5V, Teff = 3816 K

We have the following two active stars for choice. Their UV spectra are measured by IUE, and their visible-IR spectra are obtained from the PHOENIX models (Segura et al. 2005, Astrobiology, 5, 706). Lyman-alpha reconstruction as in the MUSCLES survey has not been performed for these targets. The EUV spectrum is scaled from the Lyman-alpha flux according to empirical scaling laws derived by Linsky et al. 2014, ApJ, 780, 61.

AD Leo	M4.5V, Teff = 3400 K
GJ 644		M3V, Teff = 3250 K
